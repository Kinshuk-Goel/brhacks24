          <p>In the upcoming Fall of 2023, the C.O.D.E. Club is all set to host the Bridgewater-Raritan HS Hackathon, a
            vibrant, full-day, in-person event uniting over 100 high school students from across New Jersey. This hackathon
            has received official approval from the BRHS administration and is currently in the meticulous planning stages by
            the CODE club team.</p>
          <p>
            During this exciting event, participants will join forces in teams to tackle a diverse range of STEM-related
            projects aimed at benefiting their community. These endeavors include the development of advanced computing
            solutions, the formation of mini-startup companies, the creation of innovative market prediction systems, the
            development of mobile apps to support diabetes management, and the design of environmentally-conscious
            solutions.
